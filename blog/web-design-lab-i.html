                <li>The Future Five Years</li>
                <small>
                  "Suppose I meet a friend in five years, and then I want to use a few short minutes to introduce what I have done in the past five years. 
                  Based on the HTML and Markdown codes I have learned, I designed and described several aspects that I plan to complete in the next five years, and the final results are displayed in the form of web pages. 
                  Next, I categorized what I wanted to do in the past five years into studies, life skills, travel, marriage, and career and made a brief statement about what I planned to accomplish. 
                  Finally, I compared my goals with academic goals. Academic goals have more functions of social structure than my goals."

                <li>The Begone Five Years</li>
                <small>
                  "Looking back, it is a correction to the road of life. 
                  According to HTML and MarkDown, I evaluated the meaningful things I have done in the past five years. 
                  However, I can't change those facts that have already been determined no matter how much they give me. 
                  I have to mention the only thing is choosing distance, choosing wind and rain."

              <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">My Angle</span></p>
              <p class="isPasted" style="text-align: justify;">The first thing to mention is that knowledge accumulation should be a continuous goal. A carrier that can carry information is needed to complete this knowledge accumulation. We are usually accustomed to using the brain to memorize and apply some knowledge, but memory is flawed. After the time is flushed, many things will become blurred. Therefore, multiple channels of information storage are needed to ensure that their knowledge will not be lost.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Another point to be mentioned is knowledge sharing. An example is given in Toffler's "Powershift." Ancient doctors often possessed medical knowledge that was difficult for ordinary people to obtain and therefore possessed unparalleled expertise and authority. But today, as long as you are admitted to medical school, you have the opportunity to become a doctor. Likewise, as long as you read the medical website, you can learn medical knowledge. It tells us that we live in a different era, and now we have more channels to obtain the knowledge we need.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to ask about the direct relationship between sharing and accumulation, sharing knowledge is another way of accumulating knowledge. Ability will not decrease due to sharing but an increased process. Because for some situations, we know the principles, but it is difficult to explain clearly to friends who have doubts. Knowledge sharing is the process of making existing knowledge explicit, from which you can discover your knowledge flaws and improve them. This is also my original intention of creating my portfolio website. I can't wait to join the ranks of their knowledge exchange.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In the early days of creating the website, I conceived and borrowed many website template cases for a long time. For technical considerations, I chose this simple structured website. It took a few weeks from the beginning of the website to its current appearance. During the period, I encountered many wrong questions. I also got technical support and answers from my friend Leon. I also obtained many uncertain factors on the W3Cschool forum. See what method they choose to use when they encounter the same problem to answer the question. Although not all of them are effective when I learn from them, I have also accumulated a lot of knowledge.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The construction of the web page has basically taken shape, and I don’t think there will be any significant changes in the short term. I have completed research such as HTML web page building, CSS web page beautification, PHP mail form processing. Unfinished things such as links to social media, some technical issues such as emails that the contact did not actually send to my mail, and the improvement and beautification of the content in the future. Because a lot of knowledge has not yet been figured out in the choice of content, how to express it will be easy to understand because my learning process has spent a lot of time and energy. I hope that the future results show will provide viewers with some shortcuts to learn and use.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">As for getting more people to pay attention to my website, I haven't considered it yet because I don't have enough content. However, in the future, I should participate in some UXD-related activities and exchange some insights about the portfolio with people to pay attention to it. Or modify the metadata of my website so that people who need it can focus on my website and get the content they need when searching through search engine crawlers.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the new technology should not replace the portfolio we are doing now anytime soon. The university encourages students to create a portfolio as the cornerstone of entry, and many courses also use the portfolio as a required scoring item. But, unfortunately, now I have not come into contact with better technical communication recognized by society. So, I think what I am doing now is not in vain.</p>
